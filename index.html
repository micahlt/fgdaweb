    <p class="gmtxt">Shapes + Shots is a meta game about the choices a player makes when dealing with video game characters. When a simple shooter game's characters go rogue after being gifted with too much intelligence, it's up to the player to decided how to handle them. In a world where avatars can be given to be controlled by players, or "Shotmasters," take control of Shapia, your companion and vessel when dealing with the rogue game villains. Your decisions affect how the story plays, whether the game is repaired and returned to it's simple state, or whether you allow the AIs to roam free and break them from the last of their chains. How Shapia and you change the game is up to your moral choices. Every decision you make brings the story closer to an ultimatum. So, choose wisely.</p>
