    <h2>PLAGUE DOCTOR</h2><br>
    <p>After a sickness called "Death Plague" or just "The Plague" swept the world. This happened after a sorcerer created a being and unleashed it upon the world. This "Plague Bearer" created destruction wherever it went and spawned wars between nations across the world, as the Plague Bearer turned anyone it affected into monsters. However, as turmoil raised and the world seemed to be on it's breaking point, the Plague Bearer's soul split. Fueled by the good hearted souls the Plague Bearer had taken over time, this "Plague Doctor" had all of the abilities of "Plague Bearer" and the ability to "cure" monsters and revert them to people. With the help of 10 "guardians", the Plague Doctor attempted to defeat the Plague Bearer. In a final battle between the Doctor and the Bearer, the Plague Doctor managed to weaken and seal away the Plague Bearer at the cost of it's own life. This allowed society to partially rebuild, however a weaker version of the plague still ravaged the land.  "Plague Doctor" focuses on the journey of a vessel made to hold the Plague Doctor's spirit. On their journey, they will encounter powerful allies and even deadlier enemies. </p>
